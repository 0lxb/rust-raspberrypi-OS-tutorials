# Tutorial 07 - UART Chainloader

## tl;dr

Running from an SD card was a nice experience, but it would be extremely tedious to do it for every
new binary. Let's write a [chainloader] using [position independent code]. This will be the last
binary you need to put on the SD card. Each following tutorial will provide a `chainboot` target in
the `Makefile` that lets you conveniently load the kernel over `UART`.

## Install and test it

Our chainloader is called `MiniLoad` and is inspired by [raspbootin].

You can try it with this tutorial already:
1. Depending on your target hardware:`make` or `BSP=rpi4 make`.
2. Copy `kernel8.img` to the SD card.
3. Execute `make chainboot` or `BSP=rpi4 make chainboot`.
4. Now plug in the USB Serial.
5. Observe the loader fetching a kernel over `UART`:

```console
$ make chainboot

In this tutorial, a version of the kernel from the previous tutorial is loaded
for demo purposes. In subsequent tuts, it will be the working directory's
kernel.

## Test it

The `Makefile` in this tutorial has an additional target, `qemuasm`, that lets
you nicely observe the jump from the loaded address (`0x80_XXX`) to the
relocated code at (`0x3EFF_0XXX`):

```console
$ make qemuasm
[...]

0x00080990:  d0000008  adrp     x8, #0x82000
