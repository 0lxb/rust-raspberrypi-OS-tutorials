# Tutorial 10 - Privilege Level

## tl;dr

In early boot code, we transition from the `Hypervisor` privilege level (`EL2` in AArch64) to the
`Kernel` (`EL1`) privilege level.

## Introduction

Application-grade CPUs have so-called `privilege levels`, which have different purposes:

| Typically used for | AArch64 | RISC-V | x86 |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Userspace applications | EL0 | U/VU | Ring 3 |
| OS Kernel | EL1 | S/VS | Ring 0 |
| Hypervisor | EL2 | HS | Ring -1 |
| Low-Level Firmware | EL3 | M | |

`EL` in AArch64 stands for `Exception Level`. If you want more information regarding the other
architectures, please have a look at the following links:
- [x86 privilege rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection_ring).
- [RISC-V privilege modes](https://content.riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Tue0942-riscv-hypervisor-waterman.pdf).

At this point, I strongly recommend that you glimpse over `Chapter 3` of the [Programmer‚Äôs Guide for
ARMv8-A](http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.den0024a/DEN0024A_v8_architecture_PG.pdf)
before you continue. It gives a concise overview about the topic.

## Scope of this tutorial

If you set up your SD Card exactly like mentioned in [tutorial 06], the Rpi will always start
executing in `EL2`. Since we are writing a traditional `Kernel`, we have to transition into the more
appropriate `EL1`.

[tutorial 06]: https://github.com/rust-embedded/rust-raspi3-OS-tutorials/tree/master/06_drivers_gpio_uart#boot-it-from-sd-card

## Checking for EL2 in the entrypoint

First of all, we need to ensure that we actually execute in `EL2` before we can call respective code
to transition to `EL1`:

```rust
pub unsafe extern "C" fn _start() -> ! {
    // Expect the boot core to start in EL2.
    if (bsp::cpu::BOOT_CORE_ID == cpu::smp::core_id())
        && (CurrentEL.get() == CurrentEL::EL::EL2.value)
    {
        el2_to_el1_transition()
    } else {
        // If not core0, infinitely wait for events.
        wait_forever()
    }
}
```

If this is the case, we continue with preparing the `EL2` -> `EL1` transition in
`el2_to_el1_transition()`.

## Transition preparation

Since `EL2` is more privileged than `EL1`, it has control over various processor features and can
allow or disallow `EL1` code to use them. One such example is access to timer and counter registers.
We are already using them since [tutorial 08](../08_timestamps/), so of course we want to keep them.
Therefore we set the respective flags in the [Counter-timer Hypervisor Control register] and
additionally set the virtual offset to zero so that we get the real physical value everytime:

[Counter-timer Hypervisor Control register]: https://docs.rs/cortex-a/2.4.0/src/cortex_a/regs/cnthctl_el2.rs.html

```rust
// Enable timer counter registers for EL1.
CNTHCTL_EL2.write(CNTHCTL_EL2::EL1PCEN::SET + CNTHCTL_EL2::EL1PCTEN::SET);

// No offset for reading the counters.
CNTVOFF_EL2.set(0);
```

Next, we configure the [Hypervisor Configuration Register] such that `EL1` should actually run in
`AArch64` mode, and not in `AArch32`, which would also be possible.

[Hypervisor Configuration Register]: https://docs.rs/cortex-a/2.4.0/src/cortex_a/regs/hcr_el2.rs.html

```rust
// Set EL1 execution state to AArch64.
HCR_EL2.write(HCR_EL2::RW::EL1IsAarch64);
```

## Returning from an exception that never happened

There is actually only one way to transition from a higher EL to a lower EL, which is by way of
executing the [ERET] instruction.

[ERET]: https://docs.rs/cortex-a/2.4.0/src/cortex_a/asm.rs.html#49-62

This instruction will copy the contents of the [Saved Program Status Register - EL2] to `Current
Program Status Register - EL1` and jump to the instruction address that is stored in the [Exception
Link Register - EL2].

This is basically the reverse of what is happening when an exception is taken. You'll learn about it
in an upcoming tutorial.

[Saved Program Status Register - EL2]: https://docs.rs/cortex-a/2.4.0/src/cortex_a/regs/spsr_el2.rs.html
[Exception Link Register - EL2]: https://docs.rs/cortex-a/2.4.0/src/cortex_a/regs/elr_el2.rs.html

```rust
// Set up a simulated exception return.
//
// First, fake a saved program status where all interrupts were masked and SP_EL1 was used as a
// stack pointer.
SPSR_EL2.write(
    SPSR_EL2::D::Masked
        + SPSR_EL2::A::Masked
        + SPSR_EL2::I::Masked
        + SPSR_EL2::F::Masked
        + SPSR_EL2::M::EL1h,
);

// Second, let the link register point to runtime_init().
ELR_EL2.set(runtime_init::runtime_init as *const () as u64);
```

As you can see, we are populating `ELR_EL2` with the address of the [runtime_init()] function that
we earlier used to call directly from the entrypoint.

Finally, we set the stack pointer for `SP_EL1` and call `ERET`:

[runtime_init()]: src/runtime_init.rs

```rust
// Set up SP_EL1 (stack pointer), which will be used by EL1 once we "return" to it.
SP_EL1.set(bsp::cpu::BOOT_CORE_STACK_START);

// Use `eret` to "return" to EL1. This results in execution of runtime_init() in EL1.
asm::eret()
```

## Are we stackless?

We just wrote a big inline rust function, `el2_to_el1_transition()`, that is executed in a context
where we do not have a stack yet. We should double-check the generated machine code:

```console
make objdump
[...]
Disassembly of section .text:

0000000000080000 _start:
   80000:       mrs     x8, MPIDR_EL1
   80004:       tst     x8, #0x3
   80008:       b.ne    #0x10 <_start+0x18>
   8000c:       mrs     x8, CurrentEL

   80024:       mov     w9, #0x3
   80028:       msr     CNTHCTL_EL2, x9
   8002c:       msr     CNTVOFF_EL2, x8
   80030:       adrp    x8, #0x0
   80034:       mov     w10, #-0x80000000
   80038:       mov     w11, #0x3c5
   8003c:       mov     w12, #0x80000
   80040:       msr     HCR_EL2, x10
   80044:       msr     SPSR_EL2, x11
   80048:       add     x8, x8, #0xda0
   8004c:       msr     ELR_EL2, x8
   80050:       msr     SP_EL1, x12
   80054:       eret
```

Looks good! Thanks zero-overhead abstractions in the [cortex-a] crate! :heart_eyes:

## Test it

In `main.rs`, we additionally inspect if the mask bits in `SPSR_EL2` made it to `EL1` as well:

```console
$ make chainboot
